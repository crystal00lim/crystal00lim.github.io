<div class="quote">
  <h3><i>What Really Matters at the End of Life</i></h3>
  <blockquote>"Play" <br>may sound like a funny word here. <br>But it is also one of our highest forms of adaptation. <br>Consider every major compulsory effort it takes to be human. <br>The need for food has birthed cuisine. <br>The need for shelter has given rise to architecture. <br>The need for cover, fashion. <br>And for being subjected to the clock, <br>well, we invented <br>music.</blockquote>
