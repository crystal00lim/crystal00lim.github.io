  <p style="text-align:left;">Noted quotes from noted individuals:</p>
  <p><i>The Magic Strings of Frankie Presto</i></p>
  <blockquote>You will never know all there is to know.<br>you will learn until your final days.<br>Then you will inspire others.<br>That is what an artist does.</blockquote>
  <p style="text-align:right;"><b>-Mitch Albom</b></p>
  <p><i>What Really Matters at the End of Life</i></p>
  <blockquote>"Play" <br>may sound like a funny word here. <br>But it is also one of our highest forms of adaptation. <br>Consider every major compulsory effort it takes to be human. <br>The need for food has birthed cuisine. <br>The need for shelter has given rise to architecture. <br>The need for cover, fashion. <br>And for being subjected to the clock, <br>well, we invented <br>music.</blockquote>
